The place where you can find the content I created around the game Surviving Mars.

## Mods:
- **__The Monolith__**
    - contains a Breakthrough and a well-known Building
- **__Name Your Colonists__**
    - a dialog appears for every newborn colonist/clone/android to choose a different name (or to keep the old one)
